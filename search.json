Dalhousie University is located in Mi’kma’ki, the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi’kmaq. We are all Treaty people.\nThe goal of this document is to provide you with a detailed guide on navigating programs at the University, as well as providing you with the general rules and expectations you should follow while working in the lab. We also provide some resources both for the program and for setting up and conducting research.\nThis document was inspired by several other documents (see here and here) and is a work in progress. If you have feedback and/or suggested updates, please reach out to the lab manager at jacob.belliveau@dal.ca."

If you lived in a residence or otherwise have had access to an area on campus that required you tap your DalCard and input a PIN, this door will use the same PIN. Otherwise, if you have not set up a PIN already, you can set one on the DalCard website."

However, Igor strongly recommends that students learn R and conduct analyses using R.\nIf you’ve never used R, you will first need to download R and then an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Simply downloading R is not sufficient for using R. There are several IDEs that can be used for R, the most common and specialized being RStudio. You are free to use any IDEs you would like - however, the content in this manual will assume you are using RStudio."
