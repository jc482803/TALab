You can contact them using the DalSafe app or by calling 902-494-4109. Do not call 911 - Dalhousie Security will call 911 if need be and will ensure that emergency services are capable of navigating to the correct area on campus. If you call 911 on your own, emergency services will have great difficulty locating you.\n\n\nAll students should have the DalSafe app on their mobile devices and be familiar with the services offered in the app. This app allows you to get in contact with security, and allows you to send text messages to security in case you need to be discrete. There is also a “Working Alone” feature which makes Dalhousie Security aware of where you are and allows them to check in on you.\nAs per department policy, please do not share your Banner (B00 or B01) number and PIN with anyone. When accessing the human research area on campus (where the lab spaces are located), please do not let anyone in who you do not know.\n\n\n5.2.2 Running participants\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch participants should never be run alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways have someone else within earshot when running participants. This can be an undergraduate student, volunteer, graduate student, or the lab manager. If the study design requires you be alone in a room with the participant, there should be no locked doors keeping you and the extra person apart. There are a few reasons for this, not all strictly related to safety:\n\nIn the event where someone (either you or the research participant) is made to feel uncomfortable by the actions of another, having an extra perspective or witness to the situation can be helpful to resolve disputes.\nUnfortunately, there have been incidences in the department where participants have acted maliciously towards researchers. Having a second person nearby to assist you is imperative, and may discourage assailants outright.\n\nOn this topic, the department has been working toward establishing a resource containing banned participant names and contact information. To date, this has not been established, but the lab manager Emma may have resources for you. Please reach out and ask before you begin recruiting participants.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Data safety\nAll data collected or datasets which you have access to are not to be shared with anyone. Data and research materials should not be stored on your personal computers - all materials should be stored on the lab OneDrive account. Resources are permitted to be saved to lab computers; however, these documents should also be stored on the lab OneDrive.\nAll physical research materials (from questionnaires to equipment) should not leave the lab space without explicit permission from Igor.",

Depending on the nature of your study, PROSPERO may also be an option.\nThe goal of preregistration is to delineate the steps that the project will take. In essence, you are writing the introduction and methods section of your paper. This should include:\n\nBrief overview of the background. Why is this project important? What makes it unique? What is the theoretical rationale for your project?\nMethods used:\n\nParticipant inclusion criteria, required sample size, as well as power analyses\nMeasures and/or instruments used for data collection\nPlanned analyses\n\n\nOnce you create your preregistration, you will be provided with a DOI. This DOI should be published along with your manuscript to serve as a record of your study design and decisions made. An added benefit of preregistration is that it also gives you a chance to thoroughly conceptualize your study, as well as providing you with a solid first draft of your introduction and methods section when it comes time for you to write your manuscript.\n\n10.2.1 Amending your preregistration\nPreregistration should be thought of as a plan for your research study. Regardless of how much you prepare and think ahead, it’s always a possibility that things change along your research journey. If you make changes to the design of your study, these changes should be reflected within your preregistration through an amendment. Generally you must provide: 1) the changes made, 2) the rationale for the changes, and 3) the impact of these changes on your study.",

You can think of this as journaling for academics. Each day you work on your project, once you’re done working, you should log any and all decisions made, any lingering thoughts or questions, and also make note of any relevant or key research studies you find if you did a literature search. In particular, if you resolve a question you had previously or if a key decision is made on your project, write it down in these logs. It’s also a good opportunity for you to take note of where you left off for the day, which you can consult when you return to the project and have a good starting point.\nThe format you can follow for these is up to you. These documents will be for your use only. We provide this base format for you to use or follow as you wish:\nDATE:     DD-MM-YYYY\nTOPIC(S): One-word summaries of topics covered\nNOTES:    Explanation of the topics\nTO DO:    Notes on what actions should be taken or have been taken\nTAGS:     A series of tags or keywords to aid you in finding this portion of the research log later.\nHere is an example of how these should be used:\nDATE:     19-03-2023\nTOPIC(S): design; preregistration\nNOTES:    Worked on finalizing the preregistration for the study.

Unfortunately, many participants in survey based research may not be providing genuine answers to our surveys (see Belliveau, Soucy, and Yakovenko (2022)). Within our lab, we seek to have the highest quality data possible. Part of this process is accomplished through the use of attention checks and inconsistency checks. We generally exclude participants who fail any given attention or inconsistency check in a survey. Additionally, these questions should be distributed evenly throughout the survey.",

    "text": "Once you have your survey created on REDCap or Qualtrics…\n\n\n\nBefore submitting your survey to Igor for review, you should first:\n\nCompile a document of questionnaires with references and a table of contents\nEnsure that all questions from the above document are present in the survey\nEnsure that all variables needed for your hypotheses are present in the survey\nCheck spelling, grammar, and formatting\nCheck all branching logic with any answer possibilities\nAvoid the use of unnecessary text-entry boxes (dropdown boxes or checkboxes are preferred)\nHave peers in the lab conduct test runs through the survey and determine the average completion time. Does this align with what was estimated in your ethics application?\n\n\n\n\n11.1.1 Attention checks\nWe use several types of attention checks. You should incorporate at least 1 of each type within your survey (for shorter survey designs, e.g. as part of a qualitative study, 1 or 2 attention checks in total are sufficient). The wording of these questions should be simple and straightforward; our goal is not to deceive participants, but rather catch those who are picking responses without reading the question prompts.\n\n\n\nSelect-C-type\nThese types of questions instruct participants on which answer choice to select. Participants selecting any answer other than the instructed answer choice are considered inattentive.\n\n\nQuiz-type\nThese questions quiz participants on instructions they should have read. Note that Dalhousie REB often requires this type of quiz with regards to evaluating informed consent for participants.\n\n\nHoneypot-type\nThese questions aim to minimize desirability bias. These types of questions may, for example, ask participants if they completed some training program unrelated to the study and if so, provide participants with open-ended responses for feedback on this program. Any participants who indicate participating in the training and providing feedback are considered ingenuine.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.1.2 Inconsistency checks\nThese types of questions should serve to double-check both inclusion criteria and key variables to the study. These questions can be formatted as simple repetitions (e.g., asking for participants’ age twice at two points within the survey) or by evaluating variations of the same question (e.g., asking for participants’ age at one point, and later asking for date of birth).\nAs many projects within our lab are on the topic of addiction, these questions can evaluate the behaviours or substances under examination. For example, if it’s required that participants play video games at least once per week over 3 months, you may have this question in your screening questions:\n\nHow often over the past 3 months have you played video games?\n\nDaily\nEvery 2 to 3 days\nOnce per week\nLess than once per week\nI have not played video games in the past 3 months\n\n\nHere, the first 3 answer choices are considered eligible for the study. A follow-up question later in the study evaluating participants’ gaming behaviour can be formatted as follows:\n\nOver the past 3 months, how long is your typical gaming session?\n\n&lt;1 hour\n1-3 hours\n3&lt; hours\nI have not played video games in the past 3 months\n\n\nIn this case, participants should never select the final answer choice. Any participants who do can be considered ineligible.",
