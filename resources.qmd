## Using R

For statistical analyses, students are able to use any analytic platform with which they are comfortable. However, Igor strongly recommends that students learn R and conduct analyses using R.

If you've never used R, you will first need to [download R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and then an IDE (**I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment). Simply downloading R is not sufficient for using R. There are several IDEs that can be used for R, the most common and specialized being [RStudio](https://posit.co/). You are free to use any IDEs you would like - however, the content in this manual will assume you are using RStudio.

## Setting up GitHub

All projects you work on within the lab should be stored on Github. Note that data should never be stored on Github; rather, only the analysis code and any relevant documents should be stored within.
