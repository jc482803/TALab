title: "Getting Started"

Before you begin working in this lab, all members are expected to do the below.

## Read this manual

This manual contains all of the [policies and expectations](policies.qmd) you are expected to follow while working in the lab, and provides you with many [resources](resources.qmd) you may need throughout your research journey. Our goal with this document is to add in resources as they come up through working with students on different research projects.

It is good practice to consult this manual before asking Igor for assistance on a specific topic.

## Complete Ethics Training

As an incoming student in the lab, part of your on-boarding will be to complete the [TCPS 2: CORE Course on Research Ethics](https://tcps2core.ca/welcome). You will not be permitted to participate in research within the lab until you have completed this course and emailed proof of completion to the lab manager, {{< var names.manager >}} at {{< var emails.manager >}}.

## Get Access

The Department requires that the hallway leading to the lab spaces remain locked 24/7. This door is only accessible by keycode associated with your DalCard. The lab manager will need to set up this access for you.

Before you can enter, even if you have been granted access by the Department, you will need a PIN code associated with your DalCard. If you lived in a residence or otherwise have had access to an area on campus that required you tap your DalCard and input a PIN, this door will use the same PIN. Otherwise, if you have not set up a PIN already, you can set one on the [DalCard website](https://www.dal.ca/campus_life/Dalcard/your-dalcard-account.html).

## Review the Below

Depending on whether you are an incoming [Volunteer](volunteer.qmd), [Honours or (In)dependent project student](undergrad.qmd), or [Graduate student](graduate.qmd), you may have further steps you should consider. Please consult the relevant sections.
